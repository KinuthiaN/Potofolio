      <div class="About Me">
        <p class=Background>
      <ul>
        <li>Jomo Kenyatta University - Certificate in Information Technology</li>
        <li>Zetech University - Diploma in Information Technology</li>
        <li>Moringa School - Coding Skills</li>
      </ul> </p>

          <p class="Job description">
            After finishing my studies in Zetech University, I did my internship at DT Dobie_Nairobi for two months.
          </p>

          <p>I decided to come to Moringa to perfect my skills on coding, since what I was learning at Zetech was not benefitial in anyway.
             Plus studying at Moringa would increase my chances of finding a programming job.
